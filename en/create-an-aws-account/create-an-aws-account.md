In this step you need to enter your credit card information. As long as you use free-tier services, Amazon doesn't charge anything from your credit card.

After clicking "Call Me Now" button Amazon will call you and asks 4 digit pin number which is in the Call in progress panel. You can enter or say these digits while you are in a call with Amazon.
